            Our Story
          </h3>
          <p class="subheading">
            Bulkogi Truck was founded in 2009 by the So Family (Owners Jin So &
            Jenny So, Manager Christine So) with the vision of bringing Korean
            culture and cuisine to the streets of Triangle region of North
            Carolina.
          </p>
          <p class="subheading">
            The So Family helped to pioneer the Food truck business in the
            region along with handful of food trucks that were operating at the
            time. The Bulkogi Truck earned the love of many locals with our
            authentic Korean BBQ taste and awe inspiring fusion menu. However,
            due to unfortunate illness in the family, the Bulkogi Truck closed
            its truck operation in 2012 and brick & mortar location in 2013.
          </p>

            Current operators Joe Choi and Shinae Lee along with the rest of the
            Bulkogi Truck team, who are part of the same ministry at Harvesters
            Church as the So Family, brought the truck back in June 2014 with
            the same great menu and with the renewed vision of launching young
            missionaries out into the nations! The recipe, which originally took
            a whole year to develop, has been fully inherited and incorporated
            and has not been altered in anyway.
          </p>
          <p class="subheading">
            You will be able to enjoy the same amazing Korean BBQ while helping
            to bring powerful impact to all nations, people, tribes and
            languages! We invite you to join us for some great bites and to be
            part of our story!
